# A07 — Five alanine molecules on a pentagon (POV-Ray)
This repository contains ala5.pov file to be rendered by POV-Ray that places five copies of alanine molecule at pentagon vertices. 

This folder contains the files and commands to reproduce the assignment:
- `ala.smi` — SMILES for alanine (L-alanine)
- `ala5.pov` — POV-Ray scene that places five copies of the converted alanine molecule at pentagon vertices
- `babel_povray3.inc` (from the source code for openbabel, needed to view .pov files)
- `ala.inc` (generated by `obabel` from `ala.smi` and renamed to ala.inc), edits - removed scene details so ala.inc contains only alanine molecule definition
- `ala5.png` - resulting image

## Steps to reproduce

Clone the repository and enter the `A07` folder:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo>/A07
```

commands used:
```bash
brew install povray
brew install open-babel
obabel -ismi ala.smi -opov -Oala.pov --gen3D
povray ala5.pov
```
